you need you to write a translator for English to Pig Latin to help students (and the professor) learn the language!

Rules:
1. If a word begins with a vowel, just as "ay" to the end. For example, "out" is translated into "outyay".
2. If it begins with a consonant, then we take all consonants before the first vowel and we put them on the end of the word. For example, "which" is translated into "ichwhay".
