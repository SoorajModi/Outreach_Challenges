/*
* Name: Days Calculator
* Author: Zaza H.
* Description: This Program takes in the input from the command line, which are 2 dates, in the form 'dd1 mm1 yyyy1 dd2 mm2 yyyy2'
				and caclulates the number of days between the two dates. The output of the program is simply the number of days.
				How it is done: Program will read in the numbers. First, it will check if the 2 year values are the same. If not,
				it will set a counter with the value of the difference in the years. Then it will check the months to figure out 
				the array value for the number of days. Then it will take the number of days, add it to the array value and that 
				becomes the value of the day. Do the same for the second date. Then subtract the numbers from each other, and 
				output the absolute value of said difference. If either date is a leap year, then said difference will be added 
				final number.
* Date started: September 20th 2019
* Due Date: September 27th 2019
